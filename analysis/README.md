## Dogs Helping Pets Network Simulations

#### Challenges to Consider for the DHP Network

Once a system is built, we want to be able to test if the system works as intended (**functionality**) and also evaluate the stability of the network based on user behavior (**effectiveness**).

#### Categories of Simulations Used

There are two types of simulation that can be implemented to address questions of network functionality and network effectiveness. Discrete-based simulations can be used to generate user test cases and run through the system and ensure features work as intended. Agent-based simuulations can be developed to answer the question of how effective the network is likely to be based on user behavior.

##### Discrete-based Simulation

System functions associated with users, like credential verification, adding and deleting discussion posts and status indicators (owner of a lost pet, dog trainer or both) can be tested for proper functionality. 

##### Agent-based Simulation

A more challenging problem is the question of how stable a network like this can be if there are not a balanced number of dog trainers to owners of lost pets. A more complicated simulation can be constructed which would evaluate how the system is used based on user behavior (i.e. people with lost pets discontinue using the application because there are not enough owners of trained dogs). Criteria, such as user dropout rates of the network based on owner of lost pets to trainer ratios, would have to be defined and tested.
